This package provides a continous integration tool dedicated to CNO resulting in
a web interface (http://172.22.68.130:8010/waterfall) where users/developers
can for example check that tests are still succeeding after commits in the SVN.


Here below, you can find a quick tutorial dedicated to users that want to use 
the web interface. The second section is dedicated to administrator and
developers you want to run the continuous integration tool themself on their
computer/server.
